## Course Description
This course teaches students to write write programs to solve simple physics programs on the computer. There will be weekly assignment and two projects during the semester. There will be an oral exam in the end of semester. __Please bring your laptop to class. All the practices will be based on Python 3.__ Barring documentable emergencies or observance of a certifable regious holiday, all exams must be taken at the time and place specified.

## Appendix
In addtion to the code page, we also have a [wiki page](https://github.com/qzhu2017/2017-cmp/wiki) which has extended discussions on some focused topics. Most of them were created
by the students.
